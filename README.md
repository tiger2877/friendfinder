# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

In this activity, you'll find a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys then it will compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

### Requirements

* Create a folder called `FriendFinder`. Inside the folder, organize your directories so it matches the following:

  ```
  FriendFinder
    - .gitignore
    - app
      - data
        - friends.js
      - public
        - home.html
        - survey.html
      - routing
        - apiRoutes.js
        - htmlRoutes.js
    - node_modules
    - package.json
    - server.js
  ```

### Instructions

Your will have to answer a survey with 10 questions. Each answer should be answered on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much you agree or disagree with a question.
